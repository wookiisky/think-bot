# Think Bot

## Introduction

Chrome extension:
- A handy tool for conversing with web pages, summary, etc.
- Emphasizes making the AI think a little more
- Prompts designed with 'Role' rather than workflow

It was initially created for summarizing web pages then evolved to handle tasks like abbreviation, inspiration, and critical analysis, becoming a key tool for me to enhance my cognition with AI.

Note: 
- **Only declarative writing, unfettered by the pursuit of exhaustive correctness, is truly valuable.**

- **Do not let AI think for you.**


### Vibe Coding

The entire project was built through Vibe Coding. It started as a way to quickly get a tool that could summarize web pages, but gradually grew into a large and complex project. There were attempts to refactor it, but they were only partially successful. Subsequent refactoring gave way to continuous new feature development. 
It is functional but not really well designed. Now that the features are mostly stable, a new version is being developed from scratch (Also with vibe coding).

## Core Features

### ðŸ“„ Page Conversation
