# Project Progress: Multi-Language Support

## Phase 1: Architecture and Design (Completed)

- **Objective:** Define the internationalization (i18n) strategy for the application.
- **Status:** Done
- **Deliverable:** [`design/i18n_architecture.md`](design/i18n_architecture.md)

## Phase 2: Implementation (Completed)

- **Objective:** Implement the i18n architecture.
- **Status:** Done

### Sub-tasks:
- **[Done]** Implement the core i18n framework.
- **[Done]** Internationalize the Options Page UI.
- **[Done]** Internationalize the Sidebar UI.
- **[Done]** Internationalize all other remaining UI components.

### Task: Fix Language Setting Sync Issue
- **Status**: Completed
- **Summary**: Modified the configuration management to include the `language` setting within the `basic` configuration group. This ensures that language preferences are correctly saved and synchronized across devices.
- **Details**:
  - Updated `options/modules/ui-config-manager.js` to place the `language` setting under the `basic` object.
  - Updated `js/modules/storage-config-manager.js` to correctly handle the `language` field during configuration saving and timestamp calculation.

### Task: Fix Language Setting Persistence (Attempt 2)
- **Status**: Completed
- **Summary**: After the initial fix failed, a deeper investigation revealed and corrected the root cause of the language setting not being saved. The issue was in the UI logic, not the sync/storage layer.
- **Details**:
  - **`options/modules/form-handler.js`**: Corrected `populateForm` to properly set the language selector's value from the loaded configuration (`config.basic.language`).
  - **`options/options.js`**: Removed incorrect logic that was attempting to read/write the language setting from the wrong object path. Refactored the language switcher's event handling for consistency.

### Task: Fix i18n Initialization Error in Sidebar
- **Status**: Completed
- **Summary**: Resolved a `TypeError: i18n.init is not a function` error in `sidebar/sidebar.js`.
- **Details**:
 - The `i18n.js` module is designed to initialize automatically by listening for the `DOMContentLoaded` event.
 - The explicit call to `i18n.init()` in `sidebar/sidebar.js` was unnecessary and incorrect, and has been removed.
